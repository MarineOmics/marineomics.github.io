# BETA TEST OF SITE!

The MarineOmics working group is part of the [RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/), and was formed to promote **reproducible** and **robust** genomic research in nonmodel species, but especially marine and aquatic studies. Methods in next generation sequencing and bioinformatics advance at a pace that quickly render any static set of best practices as obsolete. To support robust 'omics research now and moving forward, the working group helps disseminate guidelines through this dynamic, open-sourced website. 

**Rigorous**:  following best principles to identify and mitigate sources of error in data generation and analysis  

**Reproducible**: when others can reproduce the results with accessible data, code, and documentation 


# Guidelines for 'omics analyses 

On this website you will find a collection of guidelines, tutorials, recommended readings, and method evaluations for various 'omics analyses that are commonly used in studies of nonmodel systems (particularly marine species). Instead of providing rigid "best practices", we aim to encourage data exploration and rigorous quality control through "best practices".   

Based on the expertise of the working group, we have developed content for these topics:  

## Topics {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### Population Genomics  

* [Choosing a population genomics sequencing approach](WGS_intro.html)  
* [Whole Genome Resequencing](WGS_intro.html)  
* [Reduced Representation Sequencing](RADseq.html) 

### Functional Genomics  

* Transcriptomics with RNA-Seq (coming soon!)  
* Differential gene expression (coming soon!)  

## {-}

## Panel Seminars 
To facilitate discussions about practices and pitfalls in applying 'omics to non-model systems, we hosted [Q & A panel seminars](panels.html) with experts on topics ranging from RADseq, population genomics with WGS, and transcriptomics. Check them out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosG6JfIj7k0DizfsD5ADfQ)!

# Reproducibility in Marine Genomics  
The working group is also interested in evaluating and improving reproducibility in studies that use genomics to study adaptation in marine systems. utilizing genomics in marine species, through a peer-reviewed literature survey of data availability, code accessibility, and methods reproducibility. In Spring 2021, three undergraduate research interns contributed to this literature survey, with funding from the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/).

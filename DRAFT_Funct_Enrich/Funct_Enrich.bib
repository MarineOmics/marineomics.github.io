  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Many studies have investigated the differential
              expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in disease states and between
              different treatments, tissues and developmental stages. Given a
              list of perturbed miRNAs, it is common to predict the shared
              pathways on which they act. The standard test for functional
              enrichment typically yields dozens of significantly enriched
              functional categories, many of which appear frequently in the
              analysis of apparently unrelated diseases and conditions.
              RESULTS: We show that the most commonly used functional
              enrichment test is inappropriate for the analysis of sets of
              genes targeted by miRNAs. The hypergeometric distribution used by
              the standard method consistently results in significant P-values
              for functional enrichment for targets of randomly selected
              miRNAs, reflecting an underlying bias in the predicted gene
              targets of miRNAs as a whole. We developed an algorithm to
              measure enrichment using an empirical sampling approach, and
              applied this in a reanalysis of the gene ontology classes of
              targets of miRNA lists from 44 published studies. The vast
              majority of the miRNA target sets were not significantly enriched
              in any functional category after correction for bias. We
              therefore argue against continued use of the standard functional
              enrichment method for miRNA targets.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Many studies have investigated the differential
              expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in disease states and between
              different treatments, tissues and developmental stages. Given a
              list of perturbed miRNAs, it is common to predict the shared
              pathways on which they act. The standard test for functional
              enrichment typically yields dozens of significantly enriched
              functional categories, many of which appear frequently in the
              analysis of apparently unrelated diseases and conditions.
              RESULTS: We show that the most commonly used functional
              enrichment test is inappropriate for the analysis of sets of
              genes targeted by miRNAs. The hypergeometric distribution used by
              the standard method consistently results in significant P-values
              for functional enrichment for targets of randomly selected
              miRNAs, reflecting an underlying bias in the predicted gene
              targets of miRNAs as a whole. We developed an algorithm to
              measure enrichment using an empirical sampling approach, and
              applied this in a reanalysis of the gene ontology classes of
              targets of miRNA lists from 44 published studies. The vast
              majority of the miRNA target sets were not significantly enriched
              in any functional category after correction for bias. We
              therefore argue against continued use of the standard functional
              enrichment method for miRNA targets.",

   abstract = {Gene set enrichment tests (a.k.a. functional enrichment analysis) are among the most frequently used methods in computational biology. Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.},

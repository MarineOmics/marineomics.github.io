# About
The MarineOmics working group is part of the [RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/), and was formed to promote reproducible and robust genomic research in marine science. Methods in next generation sequencing and bioinformatics advance at a pace that quickly render any static set of best practices as obsolete. To support robust 'omics research now and moving forward, the working group will disseminate guidelines through an easily-interfaced and dynamic website that will be deployed in August 2021. To help develop content for the website, we are hosting Q & A panel seminars with experts on various topics relating to 'omics analyses in non-model systems.  

The working group is also currently hosting three undergraduate research interns with funding from the RCN-ECS. These interns are part of a subgroup conducting a literature survey to characterize trends in data availability, code accessibility, and methods reproducibility for a peer-reviewed article.

# Panel Seminar Series

Seminars are every two weeks, on **Fridays from 11:00-12:15 US Central Time**. 3-5 expert panelists will discuss each topic, with questions coming from the working group and the audience. If you would like to submit a question for the panelists ahead of time, please send an email to rcnecs.marineomics[at]gmail.com . 

Everyone is welcome to join!

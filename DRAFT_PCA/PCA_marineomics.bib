               to ordinary one-dimensional variates but also to variates of two
               or more dimensions. Marksmen side by side firing simultaneous
               shots at targets, so that the deviations are in part due to
               independent individual errors and in part to common causes such
               as wind, provide a familiar introduction to the theory of
               correlation; but only the correlation of the horizontal
               components is ordinarily discussed, whereas the complex
               consisting of horizontal and vertical deviations may be even
               more interesting. The wind at two places may be compared, using
               both components of the velocity in each place. A fluctuating
               vector is thus matched at each moment with another fluctuating
               vector. The study of individual differences in mental and
               physical traits calls for a detailed study of the relations
               between sets of correlated variates. For example the scores on a
               number of mental tests may be compared with physical
               measurements on the same persons. The questions then arise of
               determining the number and nature of the independent relations
               of mind and body shown by these data to exist, and of extracting
               from the multiplicity of correlations in the system suitable
               characterizations of these independent relations. As another
               example, the inheritance of intelligence in rats might be
               studied by applying not one but s different mental tests to N

  abstract  = "Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult
               to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique
               for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing
               interpretability but at the same time minimizing information
               loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that
               successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the
               principal components, reduces to solving an
               eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are
               defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA
               an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another
               sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed
               that are tailored to various different data types and

  abstract  = "Over the past few decades, there has been an explosion in the
               amount of publicly available sequencing data. This opens new
               opportunities for combining data sets to achieve unprecedented
               sample sizes, spatial coverage or temporal replication in
               population genomic studies. However, a common concern is that
               nonbiological differences between data sets may generate
               patterns of variation in the data that can confound real
               biological patterns, a problem known as batch effects. In this
               paper, we compare two batches of low-coverage whole genome
               sequencing (lcWGS) data generated from the same populations of
               Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). First, we show that with a
               ``batch-effect-naive'' bioinformatic pipeline, batch effects
               systematically biased our genetic diversity estimates,
               population structure inference and selection scans. We then
               demonstrate that these batch effects resulted from multiple
               technical differences between our data sets, including the
               sequencing chemistry (four-channel vs. two-channel), sequencing
               run, read type (single-end vs. paired-end), read length (125 vs.
               150 bp), DNA degradation level (degraded vs. well preserved) and
               sequencing depth (0.8$\times$ vs. 0.3$\times$ on average).
               Lastly, we illustrate that a set of simple bioinformatic
               strategies (such as different read trimming and single
               nucleotide polymorphism filtering) can be used to detect batch
               effects in our data and substantially mitigate their impact. We
               conclude that combining data sets remains a powerful approach as
               long as batch effects are explicitly accounted for. We focus on
               lcWGS data in this paper, which may be particularly vulnerable
               to certain causes of batch effects, but many of our conclusions
               also apply to other sequencing strategies.",

               powerful and cost-effective approach for population genomic
               studies in both model and nonmodel species. However, with read
               depths too low to confidently call individual genotypes, lcWGS
               requires specialized analysis tools that explicitly account for
               genotype uncertainty. A growing number of such tools have become
               available, but it can be difficult to get an overview of what
               types of analyses can be performed reliably with lcWGS data, and
               how the distribution of sequencing effort between the number of
               samples analysed and per-sample sequencing depths affects
               inference accuracy. In this introductory guide to lcWGS, we
               first illustrate how the per-sample cost for lcWGS is now
               comparable to RAD-seq and Pool-seq in many systems. We then
               provide an overview of software packages that explicitly account
               for genotype uncertainty in different types of population
               genomic inference. Next, we use both simulated and empirical
               data to assess the accuracy of allele frequency, genetic
               diversity, and linkage disequilibrium estimation, detection of
               population structure, and selection scans under different
               sequencing strategies. Our results show that spreading a given
               amount of sequencing effort across more samples with lower depth
               per sample consistently improves the accuracy of most types of
               inference, with a few notable exceptions. Finally, we assess the
               potential for using imputation to bolster inference from lcWGS
               data in nonmodel species, and discuss current limitations and
               future perspectives for lcWGS-based population genomics

  abstract = "Hybridization is a potent evolutionary process that can affect
              the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity. Because of its
              ecological and evolutionary consequences, an understanding of
              hybridization is important for basic and applied sciences,
              including conservation biology and agriculture. Herein, we review
              and discuss ideas that are relevant to the recognition of hybrids
              and hybridization. We supplement this discussion with
              simulations. The ideas we present have a long history,
              particularly in botany, and clarifying them should have practical
              consequences for managing hybridization and gene flow in plants.
              One of our primary goals is to illustrate what we can and cannot
              infer about hybrids and hybridization from molecular data; in
              other words, we ask when genetic analyses commonly used to study
              hybridization might mislead us about the history or nature of
              gene flow and selection. We focus on patterns of variation when
              hybridization is recent and populations are polymorphic, which
              are particularly informative for applied issues, such as
              contemporary hybridization following recent ecological change. We
              show that hybridization is not a singular process, but instead a
              collection of related processes with variable outcomes and
              consequences. Thus, it will often be inappropriate to generalize
              about the threats or benefits of hybridization from individual
              studies, and at minimum, it will be important to avoid
              categorical thinking about what hybridization and hybrids are. We
              recommend potential sampling and analytical approaches that
              should help us confront these complexities of hybridization.",

               to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we
               provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of
               distance metrics that saturate-a familiar concept in other
               fields but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property
               loses information about community dissimilarity, simply because
               it cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any
               common features. The phenomenon illuminates niche
               differentiation in microbial communities and indicates species

              the role that regions of low recombination or inversion play in
              adaptation of species to local environments. Many examples of
              groups of adapted genes located within inversions are arising in
              the literature, in part inspired by theory that predicts the
              evolution of these so-called ``supergenes.'' We still, however,
              have a poor understanding of how genomic heterogeneity, such as
              varying rates of recombination, may confound signals of
              selection. Here, I evaluate the effect of neutral inversions and
              recombination variation on genome scans for selection, including
              tests for selective sweeps, differentiation outlier tests, and
              association tests. There is considerable variation among methods
              in their performance, with some methods being unaffected and some
              showing elevated false positive signals within a neutral
              inversion or region of low recombination. In some cases the false

              use a quasi-independent set of SNPs to parameterize the model

              how an unbalanced sex ratio in the samples and a few sex-linked
              markers may lead to false interpretations of population structure
              and thus to potentially erroneous management recommendations.
              Here, multivariate analyses revealed two genetic clusters
              separating samples by sex instead of by expected spatial
              variation: inshore and offshore locations in lobster, or east and
              west locations in Arctic Char. To further investigate this, we
              created several subsamples artificially varying the sex ratio in
              the inshore/offshore and east/west groups and then demonstrated
              that significant genetic differentiation could be observed
              despite panmixia in lobster, and that FST values were
              overestimated in Arctic Char. This pattern was due to 12 and 94
              sex-linked markers driving differentiation for lobster and Arctic
              Char, respectively. Removing sex-linked markers led to
              nonsignificant genetic structure in lobster and a more accurate
              estimation of FST in Arctic Char. The locations of these markers
              and putative identities of genes containing or nearby the markers
              were determined using available transcriptomic and genomic data,
              and this provided new information related to sex determination in
              both species. Given that only 9.6\% of all marine/diadromous
              population genomic studies to date have reported sex information,
              we urge researchers to collect and consider individual sex
              information. Sex information is therefore relevant for avoiding
              unexpected biases due to sex-linked markers as well as for

              commonly used in population genetics to identify structure in the
              distribution of genetic variation across geographical location

              inform about historical demographic processes, little is known
              about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters
              and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show
              that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal
              components can be obtained directly from considering the average
              coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result
              provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of
              underlying processes, including migration, geographical
              isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA
              and Wright's f(st) and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely
              simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using
              examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these

  abstract  = "Population genetic studies in non-model systems increasingly use
               next-generation sequencing to obtain more loci, but such methods
               also generate more missing data that may affect downstream
               analyses. Here we focus on the principal component analysis
               (PCA) which has been widely used to explore and visualize
               population structure with mean-imputed missing data. We
               simulated data of different population models with various total
               missingness (1\%, 10\%, 20\%) introduced either randomly or
               biased among individuals or populations. We found that
               individuals biased with missing data would be dragged away from
               their real population clusters to the origin of PCA plots,
               making them indistinguishable from true admixed individuals and
               potentially leading to misinterpreted population structure. We
               also generated empirical data of the big brown bat (Eptesicus
               fuscus) using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
               (RADseq). We filtered three data sets with 19.12\%, 9.87\%, and
               1.35\% total missingness, all showing nonrandom missing data
               with biased individuals dragged towards the PCA origin,
               consistent with results from simulations. We highlight the
               importance of considering missing data effects on PCA in
               non-model systems where nonrandom missing data are common due to
               varying sample quality. To help detect missing data effects, we
               suggest to (1) plot PCA with a colour gradient showing per
               sample missingness, (2) interpret samples close to the PCA
               origin with extra caution, (3) explore filtering parameters with
               and without the missingness-biased samples, and (4) use
               complementary analyses (e.g., model-based methods) to

              principal component analysis (PCA) in population genetics and
              used PCA to produce maps summarizing human genetic variation
              across continental regions. They interpreted gradient and wave
              patterns in these maps as signatures of specific migration
              events. These interpretations have been controversial, but
              influential, and the use of PCA has become widespread in analysis
              of population genetics data. However, the behavior of PCA for
              genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, such as might

  abstract  = "This book introduces the ade4 package for R which provides
               multivariate methods for the analysis of ecological data. It is
               implemented around the mathematical concept of the duality
               diagram, and provides a unified framework for multivariate
               analysis. The authors offer a detailed presentation of the
               theoretical framework of the duality diagram and also of its
               application to real-world ecological problems. These two goals
               may seem contradictory, as they concern two separate groups of
               scientists, namely statisticians and ecologists. However,
               statistical ecology has become a scientific discipline of its
               own, and the good use of multivariate data analysis methods by
               ecologists implies a fair knowledge of the mathematical
               properties of these methods. The organization of the book is
               based on ecological questions, but these questions correspond to
               particular classes of data analysis methods. The first chapters
               present both usual and multiway data analysis methods. Further
               chapters are dedicated for example to the analysis of spatial
               data, of phylogenetic structures, and of biodiversity patterns.
               One chapter deals with multivariate data analysis graphs. In
               each chapter, the basic mathematical definitions of the methods
               and the outputs of the R functions available in ade4 are
               detailed in two different boxes. The text of the book itself can
               be read independently from these boxes. Thus the book offers the
               opportunity to find information about the ecological situation
               from which a question raises alongside the mathematical
               properties of methods that can be applied to answer this
               question, as well as the details of software outputs. Each

NGS methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty, especially for low-depth...             We here present two methods for inferring population structure and admixture proportions in low-depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Inference of population structure is essential in both population genetics and association studies, and is often performed using principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering-based approaches. NGS methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty, especially for low-depth sequencing data. Models can account for this uncertainty by working directly on genotype likelihoods of the unobserved genotypes. We propose a method for inferring population structure through PCA in an iterative heuristic approach of estimating individual allele frequencies, where we demonstrate improved accuracy in samples with low and variable sequencing depth for both simulated and real datasets. We also use the estimated individual allele frequencies in a fast non-negative matrix factorization method to estimate admixture proportions. Both methods have been implemented in the PCAngsd framework available at http://www.popgen.dk/software/.},

Due to technological advances in sequencing, such as the widely used non-invasive prenatal test, massive datasets of ultra-low coverage sequencing are being generated. These datasets are characterized by having a large amount of missing genotype information.                                         Results               We present EMU, a method for inferring population structure in the presence of rampant non-random missingness. We show through simulations that several commonly used PCA methods cannot handle missing data arisen from various sources, which leads to biased results as individuals are projected into the PC space based on their amount of missingness. In terms of accuracy, EMU outperforms an existing method that also accommodates missingness while being competitively fast. We further tested EMU on around 100K individuals of the Phase 1 dataset of the Chinese Millionome Project, that were shallowly sequenced to around 0.08\texttimes. From this data we are able to capture the population structure of the Han Chinese and to reproduce previous analysis in a matter of CPU hours instead of CPU years. EMU's capability to accurately infer population structure in the presence of missingness will be of increasing importance with the rising number of large-scale genetic datasets.

We developed gdsfmt and SNPRelate (R packages for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures) to accelerate two key computations on SNP data: principal component analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using identity-by-descent measures. The kernels of our algorithms are written in C/C++ and highly optimized. Benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of PCA and identity-by-descent are {$\sim$}8\textendash 50 times faster than the implementations provided in the popular EIGENSTRAT (v3.0) and PLINK (v1.07) programs, respectively, and can be sped up to 30\textendash 300-fold by using eight cores. SNPRelate can analyse tens of thousands of samples with millions of SNPs. For example, our package was used to perform PCA on 55 324 subjects from the `Gene-Environment Association Studies' consortium studies.

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic data is
              routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population
              structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting PCA
              analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls.
              These pitfalls include (i) capturing linkage disequilibrium (LD)
              structure instead of population structure, (ii) projected PCs
              that suffer from shrinkage bias, (iii) detecting sample outliers
              and (iv) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these
              potential issues when using PCA, and present efficient solutions
              to these. Following applications to the UK Biobank and the 1000
              Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best
              practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations
              of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr.
              RESULTS: For example, we find that PC19-PC40 in the UK Biobank
              capture complex LD structure rather than population structure.
              Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range LD regions,
              we recover 16 PCs that capture population structure only.
              Therefore, we recommend using only 16-18 PCs from the UK Biobank
              to account for population structure confounding. We also show how
              to use PCA to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous
              ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the
              PCA computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a
              shrinkage bias that becomes large for PC5 and beyond. We then
              demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using
              bigsnpr. Overall, we believe this work would be of interest for
              anyone using PCA in their analyses of genetic data, as well as
              for other omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R packages
              bigsnpr and bigutilsr can be installed from either CRAN or GitHub
              (see https://github.com/privefl/bigsnpr). A tutorial on the steps
              to perform PCA on 1000G data is available at
              https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/bedpca.html. All code
              used for this paper is available at

    abstract = "{Characterizing the nature of genetic differentiation among individuals and populations and its distribution across the genome is increasingly important to inform both conservation and management of exploited species. Atlantic Halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is an ecologically and commercially important fish species, yet knowledge of population structure and genomic diversity in this species remains lacking. Here, we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and a chromosome-level genome assembly to identify over 86 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 24 chromosome-sized scaffolds, genotyped in 734 individuals across the Northwest Atlantic. We describe subtle but significant genome-wide regional structuring between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and adjacent Atlantic continental shelf. However, the majority of genetic divergence is associated with a large putative chromosomal rearrangement (5.74 megabases) displaying high differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, but no evidence of geographic variation. Demographic reconstructions suggest periods of expansion coinciding with glacial retreat, and more recent declines in Ne. This work highlights the utility of genomic data to identify multiple sources of genetic structure and genomic diversity in commercially exploited marine species.}",

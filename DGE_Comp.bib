  abstract = "SUMMARY: Large-scale transcriptome studies with multiple samples
              per individual are widely used to study disease biology. Yet,
              current methods for differential expression are inadequate for
              cross-individual testing for these repeated measures designs.
              Most problematic, we observe across multiple datasets that
              current methods can give reproducible false-positive findings
              that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression, yet are
              unrelated to the trait of interest. Here, we introduce a
              statistical software package, dream, that increases power,
              controls the false positive rate, enables multiple types of
              hypothesis tests, and integrates with standard workflows. In 12
              analyses in 6 independent datasets, dream yields biological
              insight not found with existing software while addressing the

              adaptation. Recently, studies have shown that gene expression
              contributes to emergent stress responses such as thermal
              tolerance, with tolerant and susceptible populations showing
              distinct transcriptional profiles. However, given the dynamic
              nature of gene expression, interpreting transcriptomic results in
              a way that elucidates the functional connection between gene
              expression and the observed stress response is challenging. Here,
              we present a conceptual framework to guide interpretation of gene

              consider the evolutionary and adaptive potential of gene

  title    = "{RSEM}: accurate transcript quantification from {RNA-Seq} data
              with or without a reference genome",
  author   = "Li, Bo and Dewey, Colin N",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript
              abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript
              quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that
              map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly
              important for quantification with de novo transcriptome
              assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is
              difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same
              gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq
              experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and
              whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.
              RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for
              quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or
              paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\%
              credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also
              simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the
              software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in
              combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables
              accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced
              genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or
              comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a
              reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to
              effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate
              gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large
              numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates
              of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may
              be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the
              number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM
              is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying
              transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on
              the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful
              for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In
              addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient
              design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is
              currently relatively expensive.",

  abstract = "The pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica is a dominant member of
              the zooplankton assemblage in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, and
              is part of a relatively simple food web in nearshore marine
              Antarctic waters. As a shelled pteropod, Limacina has been
              suggested as a candidate sentinel organism for the impacts of
              ocean acidification, due to the potential for shell dissolution
              in undersaturated waters. In this study, our goal was to develop
              a transcriptomic resource for Limacina that would support
              mechanistic studies to explore the physiological response of
              Limacina to abiotic stressors such as ocean acidification and
              ocean warming. To this end, RNA sequencing libraries were
              prepared from Limacina that had been exposed to a range of pH
              levels and an elevated temperature to maximize the diversity of
              expressed genes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted on an

  title    = "Transcriptomic response of the Antarctic pteropod Limacina
              helicina antarctica to ocean acidification",
  author   = "Johnson, Kevin M and Hofmann, Gretchen E",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ocean acidification (OA), a change in ocean chemistry
              due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2 into surface oceans,
              challenges biogenic calcification in many marine organisms. Ocean
              acidification is expected to rapidly progress in polar seas, with
              regions of the Southern Ocean expected to experience severe OA
              within decades. Biologically, the consequences of OA challenge
              calcification processes and impose an energetic cost. RESULTS: In
              order to better characterize the response of a polar calcifier to
              conditions of OA, we assessed differential gene expression in the
              Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica. Experimental
              levels of pCO2 were chosen to create both contemporary pH
              conditions, and to mimic future pH expected in OA scenarios.
              Significant changes in the transcriptome were observed when
              juvenile L. h. antarctica were acclimated for 21 days to low-pH
              (7.71), mid-pH (7.9) or high-pH (8.13) conditions. Differential
              gene expression analysis of individuals maintained in the low-pH
              treatment identified down-regulation of genes involved in
              cytoskeletal structure, lipid transport, and metabolism. High pH
              exposure led to increased expression and enrichment for genes
              involved in shell formation, calcium ion binding, and DNA
              binding. Significant differential gene expression was observed in
              four major cellular and physiological processes: shell formation,
              the cellular stress response, metabolism, and neural function.
              Across these functional groups, exposure to conditions that mimic
              ocean acidification led to rapid suppression of gene expression.
              CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrated that the
              transcriptome of the juvenile pteropod, L. h. antarctica, was
              dynamic and changed in response to different levels of pCO2. In a
              global change context, exposure of L. h. antarctica to the low
              pH, high pCO2 OA conditions resulted in a suppression of
              transcripts for genes involved in key physiological processes:
              calcification, metabolism, and the cellular stress response. The
              transcriptomic response at both acute and longer-term acclimation
              time frames indicated that contemporary L. h. antarctica may not
              have the physiological plasticity necessary for adaptation to OA
              conditions expected in future decades. Lastly, the differential
              gene expression results further support the role of shelled
              pteropods such as L. h. antarctica as sentinel organisms for the
              impacts of ocean acidification.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing has become an important
               technology for studying expression levels in many types of
               genomic, and particularly transcriptomic, data. One key way of
               analysing such data is to look for elements of the data which
               display particular patterns of differential expression in order
               to take these forward for further analysis and validation.
               RESULTS: We propose a framework for defining patterns of
               differential expression and develop a novel algorithm, baySeq,
               which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns
               of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples.
               The method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data
               and derives an empirically determined prior distribution from
               the entire dataset. We examine the performance of the method on
               real and simulated data. CONCLUSIONS: Our method performs at
               least as well, and often better, than existing methods for
               analyses of pairwise differential expression in both real and
               simulated data. When we compare methods for the analysis of data
               from experimental designs involving multiple sample groups, our
               method again shows substantial gains in performance. We believe

               development and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of
               disease. RNA-seq experiments allow for the identification of
               differentially expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding
               isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods
               are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A
               number of methods exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer
               are available for identifying DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of
               interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based)
               methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so is not
               recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is
               relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more
               challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty
               that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not
               designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and
               consequently, application of them for isoform inference results
               in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased
               false discoveries for others. RESULTS: Taking advantage of the
               merits of empirical Bayesian methods, we have developed EBSeq
               for identifying DE isoforms in an RNA-seq experiment comparing
               two or more biological conditions. Results demonstrate
               substantially improved power and performance of EBSeq for

               (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the
               near future for many functional genomics applications. One of
               the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
               expression studies, involves determining whether there is
               evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly
               different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a
               Bioconductor software package for examining differential
               expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
               model is used to account for both biological and technical
               variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
               degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the
               reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with
               the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one
               phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software
               may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as
               proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Corals are capable of launching diverse immune
              defenses at the site of direct contact with pathogens, but the
              molecular mechanisms of this activity and the colony-wide effects
              of such stressors remain poorly understood. Here we compared gene
              expression profiles in eight healthy Acropora hyacinthus colonies
              against eight colonies exhibiting tissue loss commonly associated
              with white syndromes, all collected from a natural reef
              environment near Palau. Two types of tissues were sampled from
              diseased corals: visibly affected and apparently healthy.
              RESULTS: Tag-based RNA-Seq followed by weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis identified groups of co-regulated
              differentially expressed genes between all health states (disease
              lesion, apparently healthy tissues of diseased colonies, and
              fully healthy). Differences between healthy and diseased tissues
              indicate activation of several innate immunity and tissue repair
              pathways accompanied by reduced calcification and the switch
              towards metabolic reliance on stored lipids. Unaffected parts of
              diseased colonies, although displaying a trend towards these
              changes, were not significantly different from fully healthy
              samples. Still, network analysis identified a group of genes,
              suggestive of altered immunity state, that were specifically
              up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies.
              CONCLUSIONS: Similarity of fully healthy samples to apparently
              healthy parts of diseased colonies indicates that systemic
              effects of white syndromes on A. hyacinthus are weak, which
              implies that the coral colony is largely able to sustain its
              physiological performance despite disease. The genes specifically
              up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies, instead of
              being the consequence of disease, might be related to the
              originally higher susceptibility of these colonies to naturally
              occurring white syndromes.",

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate
               millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
               reference genome. In many applications, the key information
               required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
               to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
               The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
               summarization is required for a great variety of genomic
               analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in
               the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read
               summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from
               either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
               implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
               blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing
               methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)

               have generated huge amounts of data in a very short span of time
               for a single sample. These data have required the parallel
               advancement of computing tools to organize and interpret them
               meaningfully in terms of biological implications, at the same
               time using minimum computing resources to reduce computation

               using the set of open source software programs of the Tuxedo
               suite: TopHat and Cufflinks. TopHat is designed to align RNA-seq
               reads to a reference genome, while Cufflinks assembles these
               mapped reads into possible transcripts and then generates a
               final transcriptome assembly. Cufflinks also includes Cuffdiff,
               which accepts the reads assembled from two or more biological
               conditions and analyzes their differential expression of genes
               and transcripts, thus aiding in the investigation of their
               transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation under

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data
               is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
               non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
               lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
               technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
               high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
               limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
               billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
               the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
               based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
               that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in
               uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
               stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor
               of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
               million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
               12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment
               sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo
               detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
               non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
               also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche
               454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
               reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
               intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,
               corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
               AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a
               standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software

# Best Principles for 'Omics in Nonmodel Systems  

What are 'omics methods?

Best principles vs Best Practices. 

Here are a collection of guidelines, tutorials, recommended readings, and method evaluations for various 'omics analyses that are commonly used in studies of nonmodel systems (particularly marine species).

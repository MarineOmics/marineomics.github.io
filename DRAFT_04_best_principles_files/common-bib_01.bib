    abstract = { Corals worldwide are under threat from rising sea temperatures and pollution. One response to heat stress is coral bleachingâ€”the loss of photosynthetic endosymbionts that provide energy for the coral. Fuller et al. present a high-resolution genome of the coral Acropora millepora (see the Perspective by Bay and Guerrero). They were able to perform population genetic analyses with samples sequenced at lower coverage and conduct genome-wide association studies. These data were combined to generate a polygenic risk score for bleaching that can be used in coral conservation. Science this issue p. eaba4674; see also p. 249 A high-quality genome analysis of a branching stony coral helps elucidate the genetics of coral bleaching. Although reef-building corals are declining worldwide, responses to bleaching vary within and across species and are partly heritable. Toward predicting bleaching response from genomic data, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the coral Acropora millepora. We obtained whole-genome sequences for 237 phenotyped samples collected at 12 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef, among which we inferred little population structure. Scanning the genome for evidence of local adaptation, we detected signatures of long-term balancing selection in the heat-shock co-chaperone sacsin. We conducted a genome-wide association study of visual bleaching score for 213 samples, incorporating the polygenic score derived from it into a predictive model for bleaching in the wild. These results set the stage for genomics-based approaches in conservation strategies. }

  author   = "Johnson, Jerald B and Omland, Kristian S",
  abstract = "Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution
              have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make
              biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null
              hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called
              model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are
              simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used
              to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one
              particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based
              on weighted support from a complete set of competing models.
              Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain
              fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture
              analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other
              areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we
              outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways
              that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach,
              researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable
              alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially
              when more than one hypothesis is plausible.",

  abstract  = "The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and
               Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that
               both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis
               of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in
               working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general
               dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model
               selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new
               to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on
               model selection is often preferential in its treatment of
               options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular
               method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and
               textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background
               on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian
               framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in
               scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the
               methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches
               are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in
               journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is
               to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches
               to model selection and multimodel inference and present it
               specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as
               possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental
               concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have
               gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we
               provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring
               instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their
               practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a
               reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they
               can better understand their options and can make an informed
               choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.",

  abstract = "Population genomics is a fast-developing discipline with
              promising applications in a growing number of life sciences
              fields. Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics
              tools allow population genomics to exploit genome-wide
              information to identify the molecular variants underlying traits
              of interest and the evolutionary forces that modulate these
              variants through space and time. However, the cost of genomic
              analyses of multiple populations is still too high to address
              them through individual genome sequencing. Pooling individuals
              for sequencing can be a more effective strategy in Single
              Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection and allele frequency
              estimation because of a higher total coverage. However, compared
              to individual sequencing, SNP calling from pools has the
              additional difficulty of distinguishing rare variants from
              sequencing errors, which is often avoided by establishing a
              minimum threshold allele frequency for the analysis. Finding an
              optimal balance between minimizing information loss and reducing
              sequencing costs is essential to ensure the success of population
              genomics studies. Here, we have benchmarked the performance of
              SNP callers for Pool-seq data, based on different approaches,
              under different conditions, and using computer simulations and
              real data. We found that SNP callers performance varied for
              allele frequencies up to 0.35. We also found that SNP callers
              based on Bayesian (SNAPE-pooled) or maximum likelihood (MAPGD)
              approaches outperform the two heuristic callers tested (VarScan
              and PoolSNP), in terms of the balance between sensitivity and FDR
              both in simulated and sequencing data. Our results will help
              inform the selection of the most appropriate SNP caller not only
              for large-scale population studies but also in cases where the
              Pool-seq strategy is the only option, such as in metagenomic or

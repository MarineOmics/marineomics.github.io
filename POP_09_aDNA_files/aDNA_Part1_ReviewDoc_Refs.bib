  abstract = "With capabilities of sequencing ancient DNA to high coverage
              often limited by sample quality or cost, imputation of missing
              genotypes presents a possibility to increase the power of
              inference as well as cost-effectiveness for the analysis of
              ancient data. However, the high degree of uncertainty often
              associated with ancient DNA poses several methodological
              challenges, and performance of imputation methods in this context
              has not been fully explored. To gain further insights, we
              performed a systematic evaluation of imputation of ancient data
              using Beagle v4.0 and reference data from phase 3 of the 1000
              Genomes project, investigating the effects of coverage, phased
              reference, and study sample size. Making use of five ancient
              individuals with high-coverage data available, we evaluated
              imputed data for accuracy, reference bias, and genetic affinities
              as captured by principal component analysis. We obtained genotype
              concordance levels of over 99\% for data with 1$\times$ coverage,
              and similar levels of accuracy and reference bias at levels as
              low as 0.75$\times$. Our findings suggest that using imputed data
              can be a realistic option for various population genetic analyses
              even for data in coverage ranges below 1$\times$. We also show
              that a large and varied phased reference panel as well as the
              inclusion of low- to moderate-coverage ancient individuals in the
              study sample can increase imputation performance, particularly
              for rare alleles. In-depth analysis of imputed data with respect
              to genetic variants and allele frequencies gave further insight
              into the nature of errors arising during imputation, and can
              provide practical guidelines for postprocessing and validation
              prior to downstream analysis.",

              research has shown that the northern fur seal (Callorhinus
              ursinus) was extirpated from most of its range over the past
              200-800 years and that some of the extirpated populations had
              unique life history strategies. In this study, widespread
              availability of subfossils in the eastern Pacific allowed us to
              examine temporal changes in spatial genetic structure during
              massive population range contraction and partial recovery. We
              sequenced the mitochondrial control region from 40 ancient and
              365 modern samples and analyzed them through extensive
              simulations within a serial Approximate Bayesian Computation
              framework. These analyses suggest that the species maintained a
              high abundance, probably in subarctic refugia, that dispersal
              rates are likely 85\% per generation into new breeding colonies,

              diversity. High dispersal rates also suggest that previous
              evidence for divergent life history strategies in ancient

              disturbance and environmental change. When appropriately

              RESULTS: I describe an iterative method that estimates genotype
              frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate
              genotype calling from ancient sequences. The implementation of
              this method, called snpAD, performs well on high-coverage ancient

  abstract = "Genotype imputation is the process of predicting unobserved
              genotypes in a sample of individuals using a reference panel of
              haplotypes. In the last 10 years reference panels have increased
              in size by more than 100 fold. Increasing reference panel size
              improves accuracy of markers with low minor allele frequencies
              but poses ever increasing computational challenges for imputation
              methods. Here we present IMPUTE5, a genotype imputation method
              that can scale to reference panels with millions of samples. This
              method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2
              method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of
              haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast,
              accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes
              using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using
              the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE5 identifies
              locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state
              segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as
              conditioning states within the IMPUTE model. Using the HRC
              reference panel, which has ∼65,000 haplotypes, we show that
              IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster
              than BEAGLE5.1, and uses less memory than both these methods.
              Using simulated reference panels we show that IMPUTE5 scales
              sub-linearly with reference panel size. For example, keeping the
              number of imputed markers constant, increasing the reference
              panel size from 10,000 to 1 million haplotypes requires less than
              twice the computation time. As the reference panel increases in
              size IMPUTE5 is able to utilize a smaller number of reference
              haplotypes, thus reducing computational cost.",

              the past ~2,000 years in both modern and aDNA data, called HapNe.
              HapNe infers recent population size fluctuations using either IBD

              explore the role of PCR inhibitors in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies,
              140 DNA extractions were conducted on 112 Pacific salmonid
              vertebrae recovered from two archaeological sites located at
              Dionisio Point on Galiano Island, in southwestern British
              Columbia, Canada. These DNA extracts and their dilutions at 1:10
              and 1:50 were screened for the presence of a 189 base pair (bp)
              portion of the 12S mitochondrial gene that is used for species
              identification of Pacific salmonids and other fish. These
              extracts and their dilutions were also screened for the presence
              of PCR inhibitors that can cause negative results for
              amplification of salmonid mtDNA. Repeat silica extraction was
              conducted on the full concentration extracts until: (1) they
              either produced a positive result in the salmonid mtDNA reaction,
              or (2) were deemed to be free of inhibition, but failed to
              amplify in the salmonid mtDNA reaction. In the latter case, the
              samples were concluded to not contain sufficient salmonid mtDNA
              to permit PCR amplification. In obtaining positive salmonid
              species identification, repeat silica purified extracts (81/133
              successes) statistically outperformed dilutions at 1:10 (55/140,
              p=0.0018), 1:50 (63/140, p=0.0312), as well as across all

              efficacy of EGTA as a decalcifying agent as compared to EDTA,
              which is commonly employed in aDNA studies. The only extracts
              that amplified at full concentration (6/140, 4.3\%) were those in
              which EGTA decalcification was used. However, when diluted there
              was no statistical difference in the success of obtaining

              is the only known freshwater fish species to have gone extinct
              since human arrival in New Zealand. Despite its historical

              exist in museum collections globally, which were previously
              non-amenable to palaeogenetic analysis. 2. Here, we used
              high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques, specifically designed
              for formalin-fixed specimens, to generate mitochondrial genomes
              of P. oxyrhynchus , and analysed these within a temporal
              phylogenetic framework of retropinnid and osmerid taxa. 3. We

              Mya), after the height of Oligocene marine inundation in New
              Zealand. 4. Our temporal phylogenetic analysis suggests a single
              marine dispersal event between New Zealand and Australia, though

              palaeogenetic techniques can be used to test evolutionary

              microbiology, that helps reveal paleoclimate histories and
              predict future climate change. Though glacier-ice microbes are
              studied using culture or amplicon approaches, more challenging
              metagenomic approaches, which provide access to functional,
              genome-resolved information and viruses, are under-utilized,
              partly due to low biomass and potential contamination. RESULTS:
              We expand existing clean sampling procedures using controlled
              artificial ice-core experiments and adapted previously
              established low-biomass metagenomic approaches to study
              glacier-ice viruses. Controlled sampling experiments drastically
              reduced mock contaminants including bacteria, viruses, and free
              DNA to background levels. Amplicon sequencing from eight depths
              of two Tibetan Plateau ice cores revealed common glacier-ice
              lineages including Janthinobacterium, Polaromonas, Herminiimonas,
              Flavobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Methylobacterium as the
              dominant genera, while microbial communities were significantly
              different between two ice cores, associating with different
              climate conditions during deposition. Separately, ~355- and
              ~14,400-year-old ice were subject to viral enrichment and
              low-input quantitative sequencing, yielding genomic sequences for
              33 vOTUs. These were virtually all unique to this study,
              representing 28 novel genera and not a single species shared with
              225 environmentally diverse viromes. Further, 42.4\% of the vOTUs
              were identifiable temperate, which is significantly higher than
              that in gut, soil, and marine viromes, and indicates that
              temperate phages are possibly favored in glacier-ice environments
              before being frozen. In silico host predictions linked 18 vOTUs
              to co-occurring abundant bacteria (Methylobacterium,
              Sphingomonas, and Janthinobacterium), indicating that these
              phages infected ice-abundant bacterial groups before being
              archived. Functional genome annotation revealed four
              virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, particularly two
              motility genes suggest viruses potentially facilitate nutrient
              acquisition for their hosts. Finally, given their possible
              importance to methane cycling in ice, we focused on
              Methylobacterium viruses by contextualizing our ice-observed
              viruses against 123 viromes and prophages extracted from 131
              Methylobacterium genomes, revealing that the archived viruses
              might originate from soil or plants. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these
              efforts further microbial and viral sampling procedures for
              glacier ice and provide a first window into viral communities and
              functions in ancient glacier environments. Such methods and
              datasets can potentially enable researchers to contextualize new
              discoveries and begin to incorporate glacier-ice microbes and

  abstract = "Despite decades of research, identifying selective sweeps, the
              genomic footprints of positive selection, remains a core problem
              in population genetics. Of the myriad methods that have been
              developed to tackle this task, few are designed to leverage the
              potential of genomic time-series data. This is because in most
              population genetic studies of natural populations, only a single
              period of time can be sampled. Recent advancements in sequencing
              technology, including improvements in extracting and sequencing
              ancient DNA, have made repeated samplings of a population
              possible, allowing for more direct analysis of recent
              evolutionary dynamics. Serial sampling of organisms with shorter
              generation times has also become more feasible due to
              improvements in the cost and throughput of sequencing. With these
              advances in mind, here we present Timesweeper, a fast and
              accurate convolutional neural network-based tool for identifying
              selective sweeps in data consisting of multiple genomic samplings
              of a population over time. Timesweeper analyzes population
              genomic time-series data by first simulating training data under
              a demographic model appropriate for the data of interest,
              training a one-dimensional convolutional neural network on said
              simulations, and inferring which polymorphisms in this serialized
              data set were the direct target of a completed or ongoing
              selective sweep. We show that Timesweeper is accurate under
              multiple simulated demographic and sampling scenarios, identifies
              selected variants with high resolution, and estimates selection
              coefficients more accurately than existing methods. In sum, we
              show that more accurate inferences about natural selection are
              possible when genomic time-series data are available; such data
              will continue to proliferate in coming years due to both the
              sequencing of ancient samples and repeated samplings of extant
              populations with faster generation times, as well as
              experimentally evolved populations where time-series data are
              often generated. Methodological advances such as Timesweeper thus
              have the potential to help resolve the controversy over the role
              of positive selection in the genome. We provide Timesweeper as a

              diversity and (b) N e for kit foxes in western Utah, and (c)

              thresholds for N e (e.g., the 50/500 rule), observed levels

              nearly exterminated by commercial sealers during the late 18th
              and early 19th centuries. To determine the genetic consequences
              of this population bottleneck, we compared the variation at a 181
              bp section of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region from
              the bones of 26 prebottleneck fur seals versus variation in the

               difficult to ascertain from samples collected currently, could
               be a valuable material for use in conservation genetics.
               However, the genetic analysis of museum specimens is technically
               difficult because of DNA fragmentation and the deamination of
               cytosine to uracil. In recent years, various methods have been
               developed for the genetic analysis of museum specimens, such as
               data analysis techniques including next-generation sequencing.
               The development of approaches that extract historical genetic
               information from museum specimens is expected to provide a new

              demographic data, which is particularly interesting in
              populations that undergo large fluctuations in size. Taking
              advantage of eight years (2006--2013) of genetic survey data (18
              microsatellite loci) from a snow vole (Chionomys nivalis)
              population in the Swiss Alps, we explore whether and how gene
              flow and selection shape temporal variability in genetic
              diversity by counteracting the effect of genetic drift, and
              thereby maintain the high levels of heterozygosity observed in
              this population. Using simulations and empirical data, we show
              that effective population size is small, and that genetic drift
              would lead to a marked decline in genetic diversity. However,
              this force is counterbalanced by the restoring effect of
              immigration. In agreement with the predictions of neutral genetic
              theory, we found a strong, positive association between genetic
              diversity and population size, which suggests positive
              density-dependent dispersal. This is also supported by the
              observed changes in genetic composition over time. Meanwhile,
              selection for heterozygosity was weak, overriding the effect of
              drift only in one out of eight years. Altogether, our results
              highlight the importance of gene flow as a significant
              evolutionary force in shaping genetic patterns in the wild, and
              as a crucial process for the maintenance of genetic diversity in

               capture-based method for enriching the endogenous component of
               aDNA sequencing libraries. By using biotinylated RNA baits
               transcribed from genomic DNA libraries, we are able to capture
               DNA fragments from across the human genome. We demonstrate this
               method on libraries created from four Iron Age and Bronze Age
               human teeth from Bulgaria, as well as bone samples from seven
               Peruvian mummies and a Bronze Age hair sample from Denmark.
               Prior to capture, shotgun sequencing of these libraries yielded
               an average of 1.2\% of reads mapping to the human genome
               (including duplicates). After capture, this fraction increased
               substantially, with up to 59\% of reads mapped to human and
               enrichment ranging from 6- to 159-fold. Furthermore, we
               maintained coverage of the majority of regions sequenced in the
               precapture library. Intersection with the 1000 Genomes Project
               reference panel yielded an average of 50,723 SNPs (range

  abstract = "The paucity of ancient DNA (aDNA) studies in insects can be
              traced to the dismissal of the 1990s reports of DNA isolation
              from amber-entombed insects. In retrospect, amber was an obvious
              place to start, but it has since been demonstrated that DNA
              preservation is not necessarily correlated with physical
              preservation. The discipline of aDNA is rapidly progressing as
              issues regarding contamination with modern sequences and
              detection of DNA damage are addressed. Two major concerns in
              ancient DNA studies are the co-purification of DNA polymerase
              inhibitors and the presence of DNA lesions. Preliminary data
              demonstrate DNA extraction is possible from beetle remains
              isolated from packrat middens. Although specimens from permafrost
              sediments and ancient rodent middens are potential sources of
              aDNA, collection and curation procedures require modification to
              minimize contamination and optimize DNA yield. Since aDNA
              isolation in insects requires the complete destruction of fossil
              material, another consideration is the taxonomic groups that are
              adequately represented to justify the sacrifice of geological
              specimens. Although most recommended aDNA authentication
              procedures are easily followed, some are impossible for insect
              samples due to their small size, making the establishment of
              authentication procedures of aDNA from small samples a final

              unique model in this regard. Their dramatic decline from
              thousands to fewer than 100 individuals per population occurred
              range-wide and nearly simultaneously due to the 18th-19th century
              fur trade. Consequently, each sea otter population represents an
              independent natural experiment of recovery after extreme
              population decline. We designed sequence capture probes for 50 Mb
              of sea otter exonic and neutral genomic regions. We sequenced 107
              sea otters from five populations that span the species range to
              high coverage (18-76$\times$) and three historical Californian
              samples from ~1500 and ~200 years ago to low coverage

              warrant special conservation concern. We detect signals of
              extreme population decline in every surviving sea otter

              forward-in-time simulations of coding sequence. Our simulations

              decomposition coefficients (k) values of ~ 0.01, implying the
              loss of most of the organic content on decadal timescales. Under
              similar temperatures but drier conditions, k values drop to ~3 x
              10-6, permitting significant organic (chitin) content to persist
              for tens of thousands of years. One of the implications of these
              findings for paleo-environmental records older than the limit of
              carbon dating is that a value for k can be calculated based on a
              single carbon date, which then allows an estimate of likely age

               degradation of ancient DNA and potential contamination, together

               Alpine cave that, according to a previous palynomorphological
               study, have shown to contain abundant pollen grains. This offers
               a unique opportunity for comparing the two methods and,

               work performed following best practice for sedaDNA, our results

               Our preliminary data seem to indicate that paleoenvironmental
               DNA may be isolated from speleothems, but the intrinsic weakness
               of PCR-based metabarcoding poses a challenge to its

              analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but
              new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP
              chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project)
              will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher
              accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype
              imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address
              the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main
              innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that
              increases accuracy and combines information across multiple
              reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We
              find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods
              when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the
              size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made.
              We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by
              expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes
              and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at
              both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are
              15\%-20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One

              has allowed identifying biodiversity changes in the geological

              in the region, illustrating that extensive fish trade began
              during the Viking Age. We further resolve population structure
              within the Baltic and observe demographic independence for four
              local herring stocks over at least 200 generations. It has been

              ecological connectivity has therefore been controversial and
              sometimes avoided. Using pedigree and life-history data collected
              during 25 years of study, we evaluated genetic decline and rescue
